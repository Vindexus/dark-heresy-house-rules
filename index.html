			<p>When presented with a sight or an enemy that has a <strong>Fear Rating</strong>, characters must make a Fear Test. Roll a Willpower test with using the difficulty table on page 285 of the core rulebook.</p>
			<p>On a failure, the player gains 1 level of <strong>Fatigue</strong> as well negative results based on the <strong>fear tags</strong> of whatever triggered the test.</p>
			<blockquote>
				This change is to make the results of a failed fear test match its source more closely. It also removes the results that cause a player to lose control of their character, which can be very frustrating.
			</blockquote>
			<h3>
				<span class="top">Fear Tags</span>

				<span class="bottom">Fear Tags</span>
				<!--googleon: index-->
			</h3>
			<p>A source of fear can have one or more tags describing what kind of fear it instills. Which tags it has depends on what it is and what response the GM would deem thematically appropriate. New tags can be created for specific purposes.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Cowering:</strong> for a number of rounds equal to the DoF, the victim may only take a half action on their turn.</li>
				<li><strong>Fleeing:</strong> for a number of rounds equal to the DoF, the victim must attempt to flee the source of their fear. If they cannot, they suffer a -20 penalty to all tests until the end of the encounter.</li>
				<li><strong>Shaking:</strong> the victim suffers a penalty to all tests equal to -10 times DoF. This penalty is reduced by 10 at the end of each of their turns.</li>
				<li><strong>Manic:</strong> the victim gains 1 Insanity point per DoF.</li>
				<li><strong>Warping:</strong> the victim gains 1 Corruption point per DoF.</li>
			</ul>

			</h3>
			<p>When using the <strong>Delay</strong> action, a player may reduce their initiative for the rest of the combat by any amount. It cannot be later increased.</p>
			<blockquote>This is so that players that roll a high initiative aren't punished by always having their attacks be dodged.</blockquote>

			<h3>
				<span class="top">Higher Damage</span>
				<!--googleoff: index-->
				<span class="bottom">Higher Damage</span>
				<!--googleon: index-->

			</h3>
			<p>All damage types with a <strong>d10 base damage</strong> change it to a <strong>d5+5</strong> base damage. A Chainsword changes from 1d10+2 to 1d5+7.</p>
			<p>To accommodate for the change in odds for <strong>Righteous Fury</strong>, a 50% roll is required to confirm.</p>
			<blockquote>This change is to reduce the frustration of hitting a target and dealing no damage whatsoever, and to speed up combat.</blockquote>
